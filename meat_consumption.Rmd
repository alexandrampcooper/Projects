## Background
For this project I wanted to look at global meat consumption patterns from 1990 to 2023. 
You can find the link to this dataset in the section *Links*. 

Meat consumption is influenced by various factors such as living standards, diet, livestock production, consumer prices, macroeconomic uncertainty, and GDP shocks. Unlike other commodities, meat production entails high costs and results in high output prices. Hence, the demand for meat is often correlated with higher incomes and changing food consumption patterns, particularly in urban areas, where there is a preference for animal-based protein sources in diets.

While the global meat industry serves as a vital source of food and livelihood for billions of people, it also poses significant environmental and health challenges to the planet. In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards meat-alternative or vegetable-based diets in high income countries. This trend has emerged as a consequence of increasing awareness around the negative environmental and health-related consequences associated with high meat intake, particularly related to red meats. Many individuals are opting for plant-based diets as a way to mitigate the impacts of meat consumption on the environment and promote better health outcomes. Yet, whether and to what extent this has global consumption patterns over the past decades is unclear. 

For the purpose of this analysis, I aimed to examine and compare the patterns of meat consumption across different countries and regions with diverse geographical and socioeconomic characteristics over a span of 30 years.

Meat consumption is measured in thousand tonnes of carcass weight  as well as in kilograms of retail weight per capita.
This indicator is presented for beef, pig, poultry, and sheep.

```{r load data, echo=FALSE}
meat <- read.csv("C:/Users/alecoo/OneDrive - Karolinska Institutet/Desktop/Portfolio/github_repo/projects/coursera_data.Rdata/meat_consumption.csv",
                 header = T,
                 sep = ",",
                 stringsAsFactors = F)
```

## Explore dataset
```{r examine dataset}
str(meat)
head(meat)
unique(meat$measure)
unique(meat$indicator)
unique(meat$frequency)
```


```{r consumption measures, message=FALSE}
meat %>% group_by(location, subject, measure) %>% count()
kg_cap <- meat %>% filter(measure == "KG_CAP") %>% ggplot(aes(x= value)) + geom_histogram(binwidth =  2.22) + theme_minimal() + labs(x = "KG per capita", y = "n")
thnd_tonne <- meat %>% filter(measure ==  "THND_TONNE") %>% ggplot(aes(x= value)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2757.67) + theme_minimal() + labs(x = "thousand tonnes", y = "n")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(kg_cap, thnd_tonne)
```

The data set is structured so that each observation represents a region or country's consumption of either poultry, beef, pork, or veil at a specific time point. Consumption in kg per capita and thousand tonnes are represented as seperate observations.


### Clean up dataset

```{r clean dataset}
# clean up data frame
meat <- meat %>% 
  dplyr::select(-indicator,-frequency) %>% # remove unnecessary variables
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor), #change character to factor variables
         location_c = as.character(location), # keep location as a character variable
         subject = fct_collapse(subject,
                                beef = c("BEEF"),
                                pig = c("PIG"),
                                sheep = c("SHEEP"),
                                poultry = c("POULTRY"))) %>% 
  group_by(location, time, measure) %>% 
  mutate(overall_value = sum(value)) %>% # create new variable that includes the total consumption of all meat types at each time point
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(value = ifelse(measure == "KG_CAP", round(value, 2), log(value)), # transform meat consumption measures
         overall_value = ifelse(measure == "KG_CAP", round(overall_value, 2), log(overall_value)))


```


Meat consumption in thousand tonnes was log transformed to account for right skewing. Since they don't add any value to this analysis, variables **indicator** and **frequency**  were removed from the data set.


### Create new regional categories

```{r continents}
# create new continent variables
meat <- meat %>% mutate(continents = fct_collapse(location,
                                        North_America = c("CAN", "USA"),
                                        South_America = c("MEX", "ARG", "BRA", 
                                                        "CHL","PRY","PER"),
                                        Asia = c("JPN", "KOR", "CHN", "COL", 
                                                 "IND", "IDN", "IRN","ISR", 
                                                 "KAZ","MYS", "PAK", "PHL",
                                                 "SAU","THA","VNM", "TUR"),
                                        Oceania = c("AUS","NZL"),
                                        Europe = c("UKR", "NOR", "CHE", "GBR", 
                                                   "EU27", "RUS"),
                                        Africa = c("EGY","ETH", "NGA", "ZAF"),
                                        Other = c("WLD","OECD", "BRICS")))
```

Countries were grouped by geographical continent. Note, countries that spread across more than one continent such as Turkey or Russia, were allocated into one. Country groups, including OECD, BRICS and "WLD" (world) were categorized as other.

### Categorize countries based on Gross National Income (GNI) per capita over time

Categorization of countries as high-income, middle-income, or low-income may vary depending on the classification used by different organizations. However, using the World Bank's income classifications based on Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, the categorization of the countries you provided would be as follows for 1990 and 2023:

- **1990**
     - **High-income**: CAN, USA, ARG, BRA, CHL, ISR, JPN, KOR, AUS, GBR, CHE, NZL, and NOR.
     - **Middle-income**: MEX, PRY, PER, CHN, COL, IND, IDN, IRN, KAZ, MYS, PAK, PHL, SAU, THA, VNM, and TUR. 
     - **Low-income**: Not applicable 
- **2023**
     - **High-income**: CAN, USA, ISR, JPN, CHE, GBR, KOR, NOR, NZL, AUS, and SAU
     - **Middle-income**: ARG, BRA, CHL, MEX, PRY, PER, CHN, COL, IND, IDN, IRN, KAZ, MYS, PAK, PHL, SAU, THA, VNM, TUR, AUS, NZL, UKR, NOR, and RUS.
     - **Low-income**: EGY, ETH, NGA, and ZAF.

It's important to note that these classifications are based on GNI per capita and are subject to change over time as countries' economies evolve. Additionally, there may be variations in classification criteria used by different organizations or countries themselves.


```{r socioeconomic status over time }

```


### Create new time variables 

```{r time variables}
meat <- meat %>%
  mutate(decades = ifelse(time < 2000, "1990s",
                          ifelse(time < 2010, "2000s",
                                 ifelse(time < 2020, "2010s", "2020"))), # create decades variable
         time_date = make_date(time, 1, 1), # create a new date variable
         time_y = time_date - as.Date('1990-01-01'), # create underlying time variable >30years
         time_y_2000 = time_date - as.Date('2000-01-01'),
         time_y_2010 = time_date - as.Date('2010-01-01'),
         time_y = round(time_length(time_y, "years"), digits = 0),
         time_y_2000 = round(time_length(time_y_2000, "years"), digits = 0),
         time_y_2010 = round(time_length(time_y_2010, "years"), digits = 0))
```



Let's start by looking at trends of different types of meat consumption by country. 

```{r bar plot meat consumption by country, message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}

# Define UI for app that draws a histogram ----

                  value = 1990,
                  step = 1,

      selectInput("subject", "Meat type:",
                  choices = list("Beef meat" = "beef", "Pork meat" = "pig", 
                                 "Sheep meat" = "sheep", "Poultry meat" = "poultry"),
                  selected = "beef"),
      selectInput("measure", "Measurement", 
                  choices = list("Kilograms/capita" = "KG_CAP", 
                                 "Thousand Tonnes" = "THND_TONNE"),
                  selected = "Kilograms/capita"),
      selectInput("location_c", "Country/Region",
                  choices = c("All", unique(meat$location_c)),
                  selected = "All")
      
    ),
    
    # Main panel for displaying outputs ----
    mainPanel(
      
      # Output: Barplot ----
      plotOutput(outputId = "plot")
      
    )
  )
)

# Define server logic for Shiny app
server <- function(input, output) {
  # Render the plot based on the selected inputs
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    # Filter the data based on the selected inputs
    filtered_data <- meat %>%
      filter(time == input$time, subject == input$subject, measure == input$measure)
    
    # Filter for country
    if (input$location_c != "All") {

    }
    
    # Calculate bin width based on the number of unique locations
    num_unique_locations <- length(unique(filtered_data$location_c))
    bin_width <- ifelse(num_unique_locations > 1, 1, 0.1)  # Set smaller bin width if location is not 'All'
    
    # Get y-axis title from the filtered "measure" value
    y_axis_title <- ifelse(input$measure == "KG_CAP", "Kilograms/capita", "Thousand Tonnes (Log transformed)")
    
    
    # Generate ggplot object for the filtered data
    plot_obj <- filtered_data %>% arrange(value) %>% mutate(location = fct_reorder(location, value)) %>%  
      ggplot(aes(location, value, fill = value)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "median", width = bin_width) + 
      ylab(y_axis_title) + xlab("Country/Region") + labs(fill = "Consumption level") +
      theme_minimal() +
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
    
    
    # Render the ggplot object
    print(plot_obj)
  })
}

# Run the Shiny app
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)


```

## Meat Consumption by Geographic Region and Income Status 

Now let's look at average meat consumption globally, and between different geographic regions (continents) and countries of similar socioecnomic trajecotries (i.e., BRICS, OECD, or increased national incomes according to World Bank data from 1990 and 2023).  

```{r Overall consumption across time and space, echo=FALSE}

# average total meat consumption in different continents
tab1 <- meat %>% filter(continents != "Other") %>% 
  group_by(measure, decades, continents) %>% 
  get_summary_stats(overall_value, type = "common") %>% view()
tab1
# average total consumption globally and in BRICS/OECD countries
tab2 <- meat %>% filter(location%in% c("WLD", "BRICS", "OECD")) %>% 
  group_by(measure, decades, location) %>% 
  get_summary_stats(overall_value, type = "common") %>% view()
tab2
# Average total consumption in increasing GNI
tab3 <- meat %>% drop_na(increase_income) %>% 
  group_by(measure, decades, increase_income) %>% 
  get_summary_stats(overall_value, type = "common") %>% view()

tab3
```





## Rate of meat consumption

Let's see whether there's a significant difference in the rate of meat consumption in countries based on their geographic location or socioeconomic status over time. 


Let's look at trends of overall meat consumption. 



```{r total consumption over time, echo=FALSE}

# Time plot series of overall meat consumption
meat %>% 
  filter(measure == "KG_CAP" & continents != "Other" & time <= 2023) %>%
  group_by(continents, time) %>% 
  filter(!duplicated(location)) %>% 
  mutate(overall_val_cont = mean(overall_value)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(continents = fct_reorder(continents, overall_val_cont)) %>% 
  mutate(continents = fct_rev(continents)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time_y, y = overall_value, group = location))+
  geom_line(aes(group = location), color = "grey",linewidth = 0.8, alpha = 0.4)+theme_classic()+
  geom_smooth(aes(group = continents, fill = continents),
              formula =  y ~ x, method = "lm", size = 0.8, color = "black")+
  labs(y = "Kg / Capita", x = "Time since 1990 (Years)", fill = "Continents", title = paste("Trend in global overall meat consumption (kg/ capita)", "\nfrom 1990 to 2023"))+ 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),
        axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold"),
        axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold"),
        legend.title = element_text(face = "bold")) -> p
p_int <- ggplotly(p)
p_int


```


Now let's see how this compares looking at different types of meat. 

```{r meat consumption over time by type, echo=F}

# Define UI
ui2 <- fluidPage(
  
  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions ----
  sidebarLayout(
    
    # Sidebar panel for inputs
    sidebarPanel( 
      
      HTML("<h5>Type of Meat</h3>"),
      # Input values
      selectInput("subject", "Type:",
                  choices = list("Beef meat" = "beef", "Pork meat" = "pig", 
                                 "Sheep meat" = "sheep", "Poultry meat" = "poultry"),
                  selected = "beef")
      
    ),
    
    # Main panel for displaying outputs ----
    mainPanel(
      
      # Output: linegraph ----
      plotlyOutput(outputId = "plot2")
      
    )
  )
)

# Define server logic for Shiny app
server2 <- function(input, output) {
  # Render the plot based on the selected inputs
  output$plot2 <- renderPlotly({
    # Filter the data based on the selected inputs
    filtered_data2 <- meat %>%
      filter(subject == input$subject)
    
    # Generate ggplot object for the filtered data
    filtered_data2 %>% 
      filter(measure == "KG_CAP" & continents != "Other" & time <=2023) %>%
      group_by(continents, time) %>% 
      filter(!duplicated(location)) %>% 
      mutate(overall_val_cont = mean(overall_value)) %>% 
      ungroup() %>% 
      mutate(continents = fct_reorder(continents, overall_val_cont)) %>% 
      mutate(continents = fct_rev(continents)) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = time_y, y = value, group = location))+
      geom_line(aes(group = location), color = "grey",linewidth = 0.8, alpha = 0.4)+theme_classic()+
      geom_smooth(aes(group = continents, fill = continents),
                  formula =  y ~ x, method = "lm", size = 0.8, color = "black")+
      labs(y = "Kg / Capita", x = "Time since 1990 (Years)",
           fill = "Continents",  
           title = paste("Trend in global meat consumption (kg/ capita)", "\nfrom 1990 to 2023"))+ 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),
        axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold"),
        axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold"),
        legend.title = element_text(face = "bold")) -> p
plot2_obj <- ggplotly(p)
    
    
    # Render the ggplot object
    print(plot2_obj)
  })
}

# Run the Shiny app
shinyApp(ui = ui2, server = server2)


```


Linear mixed modeling with repeated measures to compare trends of consumption for different types of meat between continents and counties with increased GNI over the past 33 years. 


```{r consumption rate of different types of meat over time by continent, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
type <- c("beef", "pig", "sheep", "poultry")

for (i in type) {
  print(paste(i))
  
  # Generate dataset name based on the value of `i`
  dataset_name <- paste0("meat_", i)
  
  # Filter and mutate the dataset using dataset_name
  assign(dataset_name,
         meat %>% 
           filter(measure == "KG_CAP" & continents != "Other" & subject == i) %>% 
           mutate(continents = fct_relevel(continents, ref = "North_America")))
  
  # Fit the model using dataset_name
  lmm4 <- lmer(value ~ continents*time_y + increase_income + (time_y | location), data = get(dataset_name))
  lmm5 <- lmer(value ~ increase_income*time_y + continents + (time_y | location), data = get(dataset_name))
  # Print summary of the model
  print(summary(lmm4))
  print(summary(lmm5))
}

```
